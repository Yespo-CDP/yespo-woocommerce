## About Yespo CDP

[**Yespo**](https://yespo.io/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce) is an omnichannel customer data platform (CDP) that helps medium and large online projects easily use customer behavior data to increase additional sales. The platform allows companies to collect and combine clients' data from the website, mobile app, offline, email and direct channels for marketing automation, customer segmentation, and product recommendations.

**Trusted by**: More than 3,500 brands from 23 countries chose Yespo, and 300 of these companies are enterprise-level.

### Core CDP Features

- **Data Collection**: Collects first-party data from WooCommerce store, mobile application, direct channels (SMS, email), and offline sources
- **Profile Unification**: Processes customer data, brings it to a single view, and maintains real-time single customer profiles
- **Real-time Processing**: CDP receives and processes data in real-time for up-to-date customer profiles

## Web Tracking Events

The plugin simplifies web tracking setup, enabling enhanced personalization, product recommendations, and marketing automation. Unlike other solutions, installing web tracking on your WooCommerce site doesn't require developers or in-depth technical skills. Once you enter the correct API key into the plugin, the rest is done automatically.

### Frontend Events (via JavaScript)

**PageView**  
The default event that tracks URLs of pages. It is required for all other web tracking events to work.

**ProductPage**  
Tracks specific product pages. This key event enables a wide range of uses, such as abandoned view campaigns, discount notifications for viewed items, or win-back campaigns. For example, if a product viewed by a visitor previously goes on discount, you can notify them about the deal.

**CategoryPage**  
Monitors views of product categories on your website. You can use this information, for example, to send them an email with product recommendations for the most popular items in their viewed categoryâ€”offering a unique twist on abandoned view campaigns.

**CustomerData**  
Tracks customer data after the registration, login, or completed purchase. This essential event identifies your website visitors and links them to accounts in your system, enabling personalized campaigns, for example via email marketing.

**StatusCart**  
Tracks the current state of the shopping cart. This event is used to run some of the most effective ecommerce workflows, such as the abandoned cart, discount notifications for products in the abandoned cart, and notifications for discounts on products similar to those in the cart. For example, if a user added something to the cart but didn't purchase it, you can send them product recommendations with similar discounted items or reminder about abandoned cart.

**PurchasedItems**  
Tracks completed orders. It's essential for compiling lists of popular products for recommendations, upselling, and cross-selling. For example, if a customer purchased a phone, you can send them a message with product recommendations featuring a phone case and a charger.

**MainPage**  
Tracks that a user is currently on the main page. Necessary to display recommendations on the site.

**NotFound**  
Tracks 404 page. Necessary to display recommendations on the site.

**ProductImpression**  
Is used to show impressions for recommendation blocks in Reports.

### Performance & Optimization

The web tracking code for WooCommerce is highly optimized, ensuring fast page loading speed and uninterrupted customer experience. If you decide to stop using the Yespo CDP plugin for WooCommerce, all scripts can be safely removed from your website.
