CDP for WooCommerce: boost conversion and retention with omnichannel campaigns (email, SMS, push notifications, widgets) and product recommendations!

== Description ==

[**Yespo**](https://yespo.io/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce) **is an omnichannel customer data platform (CDP) that helps medium and large online projects easily use customer behavior data to increase additional sales.** The platform allows companies to collect and combine clients’ data from the website, mobile app, offline, email and direct channels for marketing automation, customer segmentation, and product recommendations. More than 3,500 brands from 23 countries chose **Yespo**, and 300 of these companies are enterprise-level.

### **Yespo CDP integration with WooCommerce**

We have developed a connection for WooCommerce store owners to integrate with Yespo in a few clicks. The plugin allows you to transfer to Yespo CDP:

1. contact information: after registering a customer on the site or creating a user in the WooCommerce admin, from orders, historical data;
2. order data: upon creation and status updates, historical order data;
3. website events: user activity on the website, including visited pages, contents of the cart, and orders.

When changes are made in WooCommerce (contacts: creation, update, and deletion; orders: creation and status update), this data is also updated in the system. This enables you to target valuable contact segments and build stronger customer relationships effortlessly.

We strive to empower companies [to use data](https://yespo.io/data-processing-agreement?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce) to engage with customers, making marketing automation strategies more effective. Since the Yespo database integrates seamlessly with your WooCommerce store, you can get complete information about every customer who interacts with your business. Then, you are able to use this data for personalized marketing automation across 9 channels, including push notifications, SMS, and email campaigns.

### **Yespo CDP core features**

Yespo’s [subscription](https://yespo.io/tarif-universum?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce)\-based service includes the following features:

### **Data Collection**

The customer data platform collects first-party data, which is the most valuable type of data that the company owns. CDP transfers static information (name, age, gender, city, profession, etc.) and behavioral data of users from the WooCommerce store, mobile application, direct channels (e.g., SMS and email marketing), and offline sources.

### **Profile Unification**

CDP processes customer data, brings it to a single view, and identifies information with the corresponding user profile. The system keeps a **single customer profile** up-to-date because CDP receives and processes data in real-time.

### **WooCommerce Web Tracking Features**

Web tracking enables marketing automation and personalization, allowing you to implement in your WooCommerce store the most popular and profitable ecommerce workflows through your omnichannel CDP.

The Yespo CDP WooCommerce plugin simplifies web tracking setup, enabling enhanced personalization, product recommendations, and marketing automation. The plugin transmits the following events: PageView, ProductPage, CategoryPage, CustomerData, StatusCart, PurchasedItems, MainPage, NotFound, ProductImpression.

**PageView:** The default event that tracks URLs of pages. It is required for all other web tracking events to work.
**ProductPage:** Tracks specific product pages. This key event enables a wide range of uses, such as abandoned view campaigns, discount notifications for viewed items, or win-back campaigns. For example, if a product viewed by a visitor previously goes on discount, you can notify them about the deal.
**CategoryPage:** Monitors views of product categories on your website. Also, this event tracks when the exact user views a category of products. You can use this information, for example, to send them an email with product recommendations for the most popular items in their viewed category—offering a unique twist on abandoned view campaigns.
**CustomerData:** Tracks customer data after the registration, login, or completed purchase. This essential event identifies your website visitors and links them to accounts in your system, enabling personalized campaigns, for example via email marketing.
**StatusCart:** Tracks the current state of the shopping cart. This event is used to run some of the most effective ecommerce workflows, such as the abandoned cart, discount notifications for products in the abandoned cart, and notifications for discounts on products similar to those in the cart. For example, if a user added something to the cart but didn’t purchase it, you can send them product recommendations with similar discounted items or reminder about abandoned cart.
**PurchasedItems:** Tracks completed orders. It’s essential for compiling lists of popular products for recommendations, upselling, and cross-selling. For example, if a customer purchased a phone, you can send them a message with product recommendations featuring a phone case and a charger.
**MainPage**: Tracks that a user is currently on the main page. Necessary to display recommendations on the site.
**NotFound:** Tacks 404 page. Necessary to display recommendations on the site.
**ProductImpression:** Is used to show impressions for recommendation blocks in Reports.

#### **Implementation Details**

Unlike other solutions, installing web tracking on your WooCommerce site doesn’t require developers or in-depth technical skills. Once you enter the correct API key into the plugin, the rest is done automatically.

The web tracking code for WooCommerce is highly optimized, ensuring fast page loading speed and uninterrupted customer experience.

If you decide to stop using the Yespo CDP plugin for WooCommerce, all scripts can be safely removed from your website.

### [**Customer Segmentation**](https://yespo.io/blog/customer-segmentation-key-role-types-usage-and-case-studies?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce) **for WooCommerce**

Yespo CDP allows for in-depth customer segmentation based on all available information, including customer behavior data. There is no limit to the number of conditions that can be used to form a segment. The system also offers the following advanced functions:

* Behavioral segmentation.
* [Segmentation by events](https://yespo.io/support/segmentation).
* Segmentation by parameter.
* [Predictive segmentation](https://yespo.io/blog/predictive-segmentation-101-brief-history-and-core-principles/amp) (the system has a set of ready-made algorithms for the formation of segments that predict the probability of purchasing or churning customers).
* Value-based customer segmentation.
* [RFM segmentation.](https://yespo.io/blog/rfm-segmentation?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce)
* Cohort analysis segmentation.

Processed and structured data can be immediately used in CDP for personalized omnichannel marketing campaigns on the WooCommerce website, in the mobile application, and through direct channels, such as push notifications, SMS, and email campaigns.

### [**Personalization**](https://yespo.io/site-recommendations?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce) **for WooCommerce**

Due to the completeness of data and its comprehensive analysis, you can encourage users to take the desired actions through personalized interactions. These interactions consider user needs, preferences, optimal channels, language, and timing of communication.
 [Product recommendations](https://yespo.io/blog/personalized-product-recommendations-technology-details-and-case-studies?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce) are an important tool for personalization and increased sales for WooCommerce online stores. According to our statistics, personal product recommendations generate about 20% of online store sales. Personalized product sets created in Yespo can be used on the website, in the mobile application, in email marketing, and even by consultants in offline stores.
 Thanks to the unification of data and the omnichannel nature of Yespo CDP technology, the customer receives the same offers in all channels, which provides them with a seamless and personalized user experience.
 To enable each business to fully use product recommendations in their WooCommerce stores, 200 ready-made algorithms are available in the system, and there is also the possibility of custom algorithm development.

### **Workflows Automation for WooCommerce**

The customer data platform solves the business challenge of marketing automation. Our CDP enables the creation and launching of trigger campaigns in various channels, including SMS and email marketing,  that automatically respond to customer actions or inactions.
 Over the years of analysis, the Yespo team has identified the most profitable scenarios for ecommerce:

* Reduced cost of items in the cart;
* Regular demand;
* Out of stock;
* Next best offer;
* WishList event triggers;
* Abandoned cart;
* Abandoned browse;
* Abandoned search;
* Reactivation and others.

Our team is currently working on implementing the ability to launch triggers via a plugin.

### **Multilingual Campaign Automation for WooCommerce stores**

Another challenge for companies with a complex trigger map and operations in several markets is maintaining communication in the client’s language. Yespo has a convenient solution for [automating multilingual campaigns](https://yespo.io/multilingual-campaigns?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce), which reduces work with multilingual audiences by 5 times. The interface allows the creation of a single message template for all language versions. The system will automatically determine which version to send based on the user’s browser language.

### **Omnichannel Marketing for WooCommerce**

The functionality of Yespo makes real omnichannel marketing possible: all communication channels are integrated into a single system. Each channel enriches a single profile and has access to the full set of data in the system. Thus, the channels are coordinated and complement each other, ensuring high-quality customer interaction.
 In the Yespo system, you can use up to 9 channels in a single connection:

* [Email](https://yespo.io/email-campaigns?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce)
* [Web push notifications](https://yespo.io/automated-web-push-notifications?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce)
* [Mobile push notifications](https://yespo.io/mobile-push-notifications?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce)
* [App Inbox](https://yespo.io/app-inbox?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce)
* [In-App](https://yespo.io/support/creating-in-app-message?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce)
* [Widgets](https://yespo.io/popup?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce)
* [SMS](https://yespo.io/sms-campaigns?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce)

* [Telegram](https://yespo.io/telegram?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=woocommerce)

### **User Data Management and Protection**

This plugin transmits data from your WooCommerce website to the external Yespo system to enhance the customer experience through the following system features:

1. Data collection and unification, creation of a single customer profile: the plugin sends **user contact information**, provided during registration or order placement, from your website to the Yespo system. It also transmits **order details**, including creation, status updates, and historical order data. The system automatically processes the received data and updates the customer profile.
2. Customer segmentation based on the available data within the system.
3. Marketing automation and personalization of communications across 9 direct channels.

== Installation ==

Integration of Yespo with your WooCommerce store can be done in a few clicks:

1. Install and activate the Yespo plugin.

2. A Yespo section will appear in the WordPress admin panel; go to it to authorize and start data synchronization.

3. Enter the Full access API key and click the **Synchronize** button. You can copy the API key from your [Yespo account](https://my.yespo.io/settings-ui/#/api-keys-list).

4. After clicking the **Synchronize** button, the new contacts’ and orders’ data that appear in WooCommerce will be automatically transferred to Yespo. The on-site event tracking configuration will also be completed. To ensure proper operation, make sure to [add the product feed](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/importing-product-feed) to Yespo.

**NOTE:**

* The plugin relies on data transfer via cron jobs. Ensure you have an active cron set up: either the default WordPress cron or a server-side cron on your hosting.
* Yespo plugin supports multisite configurations for WooCommerce stores in WordPress. For correct data handling, each WooCommerce store must be connected to a separate Yespo account.

* If you're using any caching plugins, make sure to install updates through the WordPress repository and clear your cache afterward to ensure all changes are properly applied.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are WordPress and WooCommerce hooks important for the Yespo plugin? =

For the Yespo WooCommerce plugin to connect with your store and perform its functions correctly (like tracking additions to the cart, updating customer information, or processing orders), it relies on specific communication points within WordPress and WooCommerce. These communication points are called "hooks."

= Which hooks does the Yespo plugin need? =

Our plugin requires a set of standard WordPress hooks and some specific WooCommerce hooks to operate effectively.

* **Standard WordPress hooks needed:**
  * `admin_notices` (Used for displaying important messages in your admin area)
  * `profile_update` (Helps to stay updated when user profiles change)
  * `delete_user` (Allows to react when a user is deleted)
  * `wp_privacy_personal_data_erased` (Ensures notifications for data erasure requests, helping with privacy compliance)
  * `admin_enqueue_scripts` (Used to load necessary scripts for the plugin's admin interface)
  * `wp_footer` (Allows to add necessary tracking or functionality to the front-end of your site)
  * `wp_login` (Helps performing actions during user login)
  * `cron_schedules` (Allows to schedule background tasks for optimal performance)
* **WooCommerce hooks needed:**
  * `woocommerce_add_to_cart` (Essential to know when a product is added to the cart)
  * `woocommerce_after_cart_item_quantity_update` (Provides information when item quantities in the cart change)
  * `woocommerce_cart_item_removed` (Informs the system when an item is removed from the cart)
  * `woocommerce_thankyou` (Crucial for tracking of successful orders and provides post-purchase experiences)

You can learn more about these hooks [here](https://docs.yespo.io/docs/installing-plugin-woocommerce-sites#wordpress--woocommerce-hooks).

= What if these hooks are missing or not working? =

* **WordPress hooks:** These are fundamental parts of WordPress and must be are almost always available. If they seem to be missing or not working, it's usually because:
  * Another plugin or your active theme is unintentionally interfering with them.
  * Custom code has been added to your site that prevents these standard hooks from working correctly (e.g., using `remove_action` or `remove_filter`).
* **WooCommerce hooks:** These are core to how WooCommerce functions and are provided by the WooCommerce plugin itself. Similar to WordPress hooks, issues usually arise if:
  * Your theme or another plugin is conflicting with WooCommerce's standard operations.
  * Custom code is interfering with these essential WooCommerce signals.
  * The essential hooks were accidentally deactivated.

If Yespo isn't working as expected, a missing or blocked hook could be the reason. This might mean certain data isn't being tracked, or features aren't triggering correctly.

= How can I check if the necessary hooks are available? =

While WordPress and WooCommerce hooks are generally present by default, conflicts can occur. Here’s what you can do:

1. **Standard troubleshooting:**
   * **Temporarily switch to a default WordPress theme** (like Twenty Twenty-Four or Storefront) and see if the issue Yespo is experiencing resolves. If it does, your theme is likely the cause.
   * **Temporarily deactivate other plugins one by one** (except WooCommerce and Yespo) to see if a specific plugin is causing a conflict.
2. **Using Diagnostic Plugins (Recommended for a clearer view):**
   * You can use helpful third-party plugins to see which hooks are active on your site. Plugins like **Query Monitor** or **WP Hooks Finder** can provide a list of active hooks. You can then check if the ones required by Yespo (listed above) are present. *Please use these tools carefully and consider deactivating them after troubleshooting, as they add some overhead.*
3. **Consult Your Developer (If applicable):**
   * If you have a developer who manages your website, they can help investigate if any custom code or specific theme/plugin configurations are affecting these hooks. Searching through theme and plugin code for these hook names is a technical step best suited for a developer.

= What if I find a missing or conflicting hook? =

If you suspect a theme or another plugin is causing the issue, we recommend reaching out to the support team for that theme or plugin for assistance. If you've identified custom code that's interfering, you or your developer will need to adjust it to ensure it doesn't block required hooks.

If you've tried these steps and are still having trouble, please contact our Yespo support team, and we'll do our best to assist you\!
