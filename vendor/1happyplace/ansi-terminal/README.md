# ANSI Terminal
 
The ANSI/Terminal class controls a terminal shell such as bash. It is an abstract base class for Clio and the CLI HTML software.
It provides a basic set of methods to command a terminal as well as prompt the user for information.

If you want to use this layer, simply instantiate BasicTerminal, which uses echo for output.  BasicTerminal uses verbose and 
obvious methods, making for quickand easy use for simple requirements. If you want to move on to more capability, [Clio](http:\\clio.1happyplace.com\clio\clio.html) 
provides a more extensive, easily chained language and extensive styling capability, and [CLI HTML](clio.1happyplace.com/html/introduction.html) provides all that, 
plus full-up text positioning such as lists and tables.

For a full list of methods, see [ANSI Terminal](http://clio.1happyplace.com/clio/ansi-terminal.html).
